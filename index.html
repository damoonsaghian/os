<h2>1, computers</h2><div>computers must be portable devices with a USBC (USB4 without PCIe) port,</div><div>	which connects to a display and also provides power</div><div>ports on the display: USB dock, ethernet, audio jack, DP and HDMI (to connect to extra displays)</div><div>the display can have speaker, camera, light sensor and auto brightness</div><div>still, it's useful to have these extra ports (on the computer) for compatibility:</div><div>	HDMI, audio jack, ethernet, USB</div><div><p></p></div><div>cpu, memory, peripherals, this seems to be the only practical architecture for the hardware of computers</div><div>cpu runs a sequence of simple computations, called instruction codes, one by one</div><div>compilers are special programs that generate instruction codes,</div><div>	from a program written in a structured and human readable language</div><div><p></p></div><div>there is always possibility of backdoors for closed source CPU,</div><div>	especially if the boot firmware is also closed source</div><div>recently introduction of "secure execution environment" makes this situation even worse</div><div>it's a closed source, full'blown, always'running mini operating system,</div><div>	with full access to the whole system (including memory and network)</div><div>furthermore they have made it practically impossible for users to disable it</div><div>this mess of a design cries out for hidden and quite sophisticated backdoors</div><div><a

href='https://blog.invisiblethings.org/papers/2015/x86_harmful.pdf'>https://blog.invisiblethings.org/papers/2015/x86_harmful.pdf</a></div><div><p></p></div><div>on X86 architectures the default boot firmware on nearly all systems are closed source</div><div>flashing a CoreBoot based boot firmware is possible, but there still will be closed source parts (Intel FSP)</div><div>in addition, there is no easy way to get rid of Intel ME (or AMD PSP),</div><div>	though there are some hacks to disable (but not completely remove) it:</div><div>	<a href='https://puri.sm/posts/deep-dive-into-intel-me-disablement/'>https://puri.sm/posts/deep-dive-into-intel-me-disablement/</a></div><div><p></p></div><div>ARM architecture is closed source too, but in most cases, boot firmwares are open source (U-Boot or EDK2)</div><div>ARM TrustZone can host an open source operating system too, apparently:</div><div>	<a href='https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17783357'>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17783357</a></div><div>GPU with open source driver: Qualcomm/Adreno</div><div><p></p></div><div>open source CPU: RISC-V, Power ISA</div><div><p></p></div><div>one read'only boot firmware, plus a writable one</div><div>, interrupted flashing does not brick the device</div><div>, no need for complex signing mechanism to make sure a device's firmware is not malicious</div><div>	you just have to make sure that the device boots from the read'only flash,</div><div>	and that the writable flash is empty, the first time you boot the device</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>asynchronous digital circuits</b></div><div>in conventional digital circuits when the inputs change, the outputs can have temporary invalid values,</div><div>	until they stabilize to the valid values</div><div>but for the circuit to do its job, gates with memory (registers),</div><div>	must operate only when the inputs have correct values</div><div>one solution is to synchronize registers with a global clock signal</div><div>	the period of clock signal is made long enough for the circuit to become stable</div><div><p></p></div><div>disadvantages of synchronous circuits:</div><div>, we have to split long operations into several smaller ones,</div><div>	which can be performed in successive clock cycles (a technique known as pipelining)</div><div>	otherwise the circuit would be slow and inefficient</div><div>, distributing a high'fan'out, timing'sensitive clock signal can be complicated</div><div>, electromagnetic interference at the clock frequency and its harmonics</div><div>, widely distributed clock signal takes a lot of power, and must run whether the circuit is receiving inputs or not</div><div>although "clock gating" can help to reduce some of the problems of synchronous circuits,</div><div>	i think the real solution is to use asynchronous circuits</div><div><p></p></div><div>the only sane kind of asynchronous circuit which i could imagine is this:</div><div>, next to any data wire, there is a control wire which determines if the data is valid or not</div><div>, when a register wants to change its outputs, it first invalidates them,</div><div>	for a duration equal to the delay of one gate</div><div>, any gate receiving an invalid input, invalidates its outputs</div><div>, this way all data which is going to change in the future, is first invalidated</div><div>, registers operate only when all inputs are valid</div>
<h2>2, operating system</h2><div>programs usually do not run directly on computer hardware</div><div>instead they run on a more sophisticated software machine (a virtual machine) called the kernel</div><div>in theory we can live without a kernel (an idea sometimes called a library operating system),</div><div>	and it can be useful for some use cases (like IoT devices),</div><div>	but a kernel based operating system makes developing and testing programs, much easier</div><div>Linux is a highly developed, constantly evolving, open'source kernel</div><div><p></p></div><div>using Debian we can easily setup a Linux based operating system</div><div>anything which needs a kernel'based operating system can use Debian:</div><div>, it supports a wide range of hardware architectures</div><div>, it's suitable for systems with limited resources</div><div>, the stable release provides a highly tested system for sensitive use cases</div><div><p></p></div><div>boot to a Debian live system</div><div>if Debian live is not available for an architecture, as a workaround,</div><div>	intall Debian on a removable storage device, and use that as a live system</div><div>then run this in a terminal (note that s390x and mips architectures are not supported):</div><div>; sudo sh &lt;path-to-this-project-directory&gt;/install.sh</div><div><p></p></div><div>in the installed system:</div><div>press and release "alt" to open app launcher (then press "space" to launch the selected app)</div><div>press "alt" twice to switch between the two most recent apps</div><div>press "alt+space" or "alt+tab" to switch between windows of a workspace</div><div>press "alt+enter" to close focused window</div><div><p></p></div><div>while in app launcher, press "enter" to open session manager, in which you can:</div><div>	lock the session, suspend, exit, reboot, or poweroff</div><div><p></p></div><div>a terminal emulator application is installed by default</div><div>"system" is a command'line program which can be used to:</div><div>	manage connections, set timezone, change passwords, and manage installed packages</div><div><p></p></div><div>implementing atomic upgrade does not worth the effort, because to have a really fail'safe system,</div><div>	redundant backups are necessary anyway</div><div>to fix a broken system (eg due to powerloss during a system upgrade), the live system can be used</div><div><p></p></div><div>to run a command as root:</div><div>; sudo command</div><div>this will switch to the first available virtual terminal, shows the command at the top,</div><div>	and asks for root password</div><div>if the entered password is correct it returns back to previous virtual terminal,</div><div>	and runs the command as root</div><div><p></p></div><div>note that you can't login as root; root account is locked</div><div>also you must never type the user's password anywhere except at the login prompt</div><div>	(and make sure that the login prompt isn't fake, by pressing "F8" key for locking/unlocking)</div><div>this means that if a malicious program steals root password (eg by faking the password entry),</div><div>	it still can't run programs as root (because it can't enter the password in a virtual terminal)</div><div>take a look at these:</div><div><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/8mlil7/whats_the_point_of_the_sudo_password_prompt_if/'>https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/8mlil7/whats_the_point_of_the_sudo_password_prompt_if/</a></div><div><a href='https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/119410/why-should-one-use-sudo'>https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/119410/why-should-one-use-sudo</a></div><div><p></p></div><div>to protect the computer from physical attacks, don't leave the computer with an unlocked session</div><div>in addition you must:</div><div>, somehow prevent tampering with hardware</div><div>, protect boot firmware by a password</div><div>, disable changing the storage device used for booting</div><div>these can make physical attacks more difficult, but keep this in mind:</div><div>	physical access to a computer is root access, given enough time and resources</div></body></html>
