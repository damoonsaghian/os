programs usually do not run directly on computer hardware
instead they run on a more sophisticated software machine (a virtual machine) called the kernel
in theory we can live without a kernel (an idea sometimes called a library operating system),
	and it can be useful for some use cases (like IoT devices),
	but a kernel based operating system makes developing and testing programs, much easier
Linux is a highly developed, constantly evolving, open'source kernel
using Debian we can easily setup a Linux based operating system

boot to a Debian live system
if Debian live is not available for an architecture, as a workaround,
	install Debian on a removable storage device, and use that as a live system
then run this in a terminal (note that s390x and mips architectures are not supported):
; sudo sh install.sh

in the installed system:
press "super" (mod+mod) or "alt+space" to open a list of installed apps
press "super+super" or "alt+tab" to switch between most recent apps
press "super+space" or "alt+grave" to switch between windows of an app
press "super+," or "alt+esc" to close a window

a terminal emulator application is installed by default
"system" is a command'line program which can be used to:
	manage connections, set timezone, change passwords, or manage installed packages

implementing atomic upgrade does not worth the effort, because to have a really fail'safe system,
	redundant backups are necessary anyway
to fix a broken system (eg due to power outage during a system upgrade), the live system can be used

other than Debian packages, you can install apps
an app is simply a source code directory, containing a file named "install.sh"
to install an app, just add its URL (gnunet/git) to "~/.local/apps/url-list"
there must be an empty line between URL lines
after each URL line, there can be a public key,
	which will be used to check the signature of the downloaded files

to run a command as root:
; sudo command
this will switch to the first available virtual terminal, shows the command at the top,
	and asks for root password
if the entered password is correct it returns back to previous virtual terminal,
	and runs the command as root

note that you can't login as root; root account is locked
also you must never type the user's password anywhere except at the login prompt
	(and make sure that the login prompt isn't fake, by pressing "F8" key for locking/unlocking)
this means that if a malicious program steals root password (eg by faking the password entry),
	it still can't run programs as root (because it can't enter the password in a virtual terminal)
take a look at these:

"https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/119410/why-should-one-use-sudo"

to protect the computer from physical attacks, don't leave the computer with an unlocked session
in addition you must:
, somehow prevent tampering with hardware
, protect boot firmware by a password
, disable changing the storage device used for booting
these can make physical attacks more difficult, but keep this in mind:
	physical access to a computer is root access, given enough time and resources
